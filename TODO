> inband ACK mechanism or separate probing packet
  > explain the mechanisms and all options for people to discuss
  > the decision tree can be inband or probing
  > in case of inband
    > TCP option or UDP header
    > some IFA packet 
  > in case of probing packet

> Example implementation on IFA or IOAM
  > Intel, Nvidia, Cisco and marvel can work on p4, having p4 code is great
  > Broacom might insist on IFA
  > We agree to write the concrete header formats: IFA 2.0, IETF IOAM, p4 INT
    > (Rui) INVITE broadcom folk to give an update. Ask to open the template: IP option, metadata part, etc.

> Example implementation on RDMA RoCEv2
  > header format 
  > pesudo-code for implementation
  > RoCEv2 doesnt have ACK packet so we use probing packet with MAD packet
    > customized CNP packet in return using the reserved 16 bytes 
    > do we need to specify the usage of the reserved bytes in IBTA or MLNX?
    
> TCP version of HPCC
  > embeded into TCP option header
  > how to handle TCP LSO (64KB or 32KB)?
    
> Path migration
  > switch paths once a path is congested or failed
